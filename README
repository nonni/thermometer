Parse weather data from NOAA Satellite and Information Service (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/res40.pl) to Mongodb.


Configuring Mongodb:

Make sure geospatial indexing is enabled for the stations collection:
    "db.stations.ensureIndex( { loc : "2d" } )"
It is also be good idea to create some indexes to speed up lookup queries:
    "db.stations.ensureIndex({usaf: 1, wban:1})"
    "db.observations.ensureIndex({date: 1, station: 1, wban: 1})"
